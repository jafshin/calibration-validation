## sa3-to-sa1

This code nominates an sa1 region for each sa3 regions. The preference is sa1 regions with a:

1. Vline station
2. Regional bus stop
3. Metro train station
4. Regular bus stop

Any ties (e.g., two Vline stations in one sa3) are broken by picking the sa1 thatâ€™s closest to the center of the sa3 region.
